- question: What is the Gateway in ONDC?
  answer: The Gateway is a crucial component in the ONDC network that facilitates
    discovery by routing search requests from Buyer Apps (BAPs) to all registered
    Seller Apps (BPPs). It does not send responses back to the BAP—its role is limited
    to multicasting the search request across the network. The BPPs then respond directly
    to the BAP with on_search. Gateway Endpoints:-

- question: What is the registry in ONDC?
  answer: 'The ONDC Registry is a central directory of all Network Participants (NPs)
    in a given environment (Staging, Preprod, or Prod). It stores: NP’s base API URLs
    Supported domains (e.g., Grocery, Mobility) Each environment has its own registry;
    participants must subscribe to the appropriate registry before transacting in
    that environment.'

- question: Do all messages pass through the Gateway?
  answer: No. Only discovery-phase messages (like /search) go through the Gateway.
    After sellers respond to discovery, all other protocol messages—such as /select,
    /init, /confirm, etc.—are exchanged directly between Buyer App and Seller App
    over secure channels (peer-to-peer).

    reducing noise and improving efficiency.'

- question: Can a participant in the Staging environment transact with one in Production?
  answer: No. Each environment is logically and technically isolated. Participants
    registered in one environment cannot communicate with participants in another.
    Ensure that all transacting parties are in the same environment.

    '
  answer: 'The current API contract is at version 1.2, while the previous version,
    1.1, has been deprecated. Version 1.1 established the basic framework for essential
    retail operations, enabling the smooth execution of the happy flow along with
    other common processes like order cancellations. To improve the overall functionality
    and coverage of the contract, version 1.2.0 was introduced. This new version not
    only aims to enhance the robustness of the API but also to better align it with
    the sophisticated functionalities found in platform ecosystems, thereby providing
    buyers with a more consistent and seamless user experience. Key improvements in
    version 1.2.0 include advanced catalog caching mechanisms, as well as support
    for additional scenarios such as product customizations, handling of variants,
    streamlined return processes, and order tracking capabilities.

  answer: 'Steps to be followed are as follows: 1) Seller Application need to initiate
    recon API call to the respective buyer app(s) highlighting order level details
    including Order details such as Amount, Commission, With-holding amount, TDS and
    TCS 2) Buyer application needs to respond back with “on_recon” to either convey
    their agreement to seller application’s workings or reject the same a) If the
    “recon_accord” flag is true: Buyer Application agrees to the calculations of Seller
    application as per Recon API and requests the seller application to send a /settle
    call basis the same on the “Settlement Date” mentioned in the call. b) If the
    “recon_accord” flag is false: : Buyer Application disagrees with the calculations
    of Seller application as per Recon API and would send the order level calculations
    along with “diff_Value” wherever applicable. 3) Seller application basis the calculations
    can re-initiate the recon call, with the updated values if applicable and Step
    2 would restart. The Recon flow ultimately positively closes with Buyer Application
    (Collector) responding with “Recon_Accord” = True and provide settlement date
    Both Parties can at any stage raise an IGM complaint for resolution in case the
    recon, on_recon flow doesn’t provide a satisfactory resolution. Please find the
