- question: Can lookup responses be cached?
  answer: 'Yes, caching lookup responses can help optimize performance. However, it’s
    important to refresh the cache periodically—for example, every few hours—or in
    real time for critical operations such as order confirmations, to ensure data
    remains accurate and up to date. Here are some common errors you might see:'

    generating the header does not exist in the registry records. Resolution: Ensure
    that the header format strictly matches the expected structure (as shown below),
    without any backslashes, escape characters, or unintended formatting. Additionally,
    verify that the subscriber_id used exists in the registry as a SUBSCRIBED one.

- question: As we are aggregating multiple buyers for multiple cities, the search
    gets initiated and every search result via the gateway results in 3 GB of data.
  answer: Search should be initiated for each city and cached on your end. Since the
    catalog includes full details of the seller app/sellers and their serviceability,
    you may ingest, process, and cache it on your side. The buyer can then search
    directly from these cached results. As the number of seller NPs and sellers on
    the network grows, the volume of resultant data will also increase. Therefore,
    effective filtering and catalog rejection processes should be implemented to eliminate
    poor-quality catalogs or payloads.Also, please note that the /on_search response
    is sent directly to the buyer app’s endpoint and not routed through the gateway.

- question: What is on_search? Who sends on_search and to whom?
  answer: The /on_search call is the response from the Seller NP to the Buyer NP's
    /search request.  It contains the requested catalog data (for full refresh) or
    the incremental updates.  The Buyer NP acknowledges the /on_search response with
    an ACK or NACK.  A NACK indicates an issue with ingesting the response, such as
    missing providers, locations, or items.  The on_search response can also include
    deep links to the provider's store on the buyer app and options for the Buyer
    NP to communicate promotions.

- question: When is the init call made?
  answer: '- The /init call is made by the buyer app directly to the seller app after
    the /select call. It signifies the initiation of the order process.  The primary
    purpose of this call is to collect the buyer''s delivery and billing addresses
    and formally initiate the order.  The seller app responds to the /init call with
    the /on_init callback, confirming the order initialization and potentially providing
    additional details.  After the /init and /on_init exchange, both the buyer and
    seller apps possess the necessary product and address information to proceed further
    in the order fulfillment process.  The /init call marks the transition from product
    discovery and selection to the actual order processing stage.  It sets the stage
    for subsequent steps like payment processing and order confirmation.  The direct
    peer-to-peer communication between buyer and seller apps, established during the
    /select call, continues in the /init call, ensuring efficient and real-time information
    exchange. /on_init'

- question: When is on_inti call made?
  answer: 'The on_init call is made by the seller app in response to the init call
    from the buyer app.  The init call signifies the buyer''s intention to initialize
    an order after selecting products through the /search and /select calls.  The
    on_init call serves two primary purposes: Acknowledge Order Initialization and
    Provide Quote: The seller app acknowledges the order initialization request and
    sends back a detailed quote for the order. This quote includes the final price
    breakdown, including item costs, taxes, delivery charges, and any applicable discounts
    or offers.  This allows the buyer to review the final cost before confirming the
    order. Collect Payment (if applicable):  If the seller requires pre-payment, the
    on_init call can also include information necessary for the buyer to proceed with
    payment. This might involve redirecting the buyer to a payment gateway or providing
    payment instructions.  If the payment is handled through a separate process (e.g.,
    Cash on Delivery), this step might be skipped.'

- question: When is the confirmed API call made?
  answer: The /confirm call is made by the Buyer Network Participant (BNP) to the
    Seller Network Participant (SNP) after the buyer has reviewed and accepted the
    final order details provided in the /on_init response.  It signifies the buyer's
    commitment to the purchase.  The SNP should not initiate processing or fulfillment
    of the order until it receives an ACK for the subsequent /on_confirm call.  It's
    crucial that both /confirm and /on_confirm are idempotent to handle potential
    network issues and retries.  The order id, created by the BNP and unique across
    the network, and must be the same in both the /confirm and /on_confirm calls.

- question: When is the on_confirm call made?
  answer: 'The /on_confirm call is made by the Seller Network Participant (SNP) to
    the Buyer Network Participant (BNP) after receiving the /confirm call from the
    BNP.  It signifies the seller''s confirmation of the order.  Here''s a breakdown
    of the process: /confirm Call (BNP to SNP): The buyer application initiates the
    /confirm call to the seller application. This call contains the final order details,
    including items, quantities, and the agreed-upon quote (which should be the same
    as the quote received in the /on_init call).  The buyer creates a unique order_id
    at this stage. SNP Validations: Upon receiving the /confirm call, the SNP performs
    validations to ensure the order details are accurate and acceptable.  This includes
    checking item availability, pricing, and any other relevant factors.  The SNP
    does not forward the order to the merchant at this point. ACK or NACK to /confirm
    (SNP to BNP): Successful Validation (ACK): If the validation is successful, the
    SNP responds with an ACK (Acknowledgement) to the /confirm call.  This indicates
    to the BNP that the order is accepted.  The SNP creates the order in their system,
    but still does not forward it to the merchant. Validation Failure (NACK): If the
    validation fails, the SNP responds with a NACK (Negative Acknowledgement) along
    with an error code (e.g., 31002 for order validation failure). The BNP should
    then cancel the order with a specific reason code (e.g., 999). Internal Errors
    (NACK): The SNP might also send a NACK due to internal errors (e.g., HTTP 504).  This
    would include a retriable error code (e.g., 31001), prompting the BNP to retry
    the /confirm call. /on_confirm Call (SNP to BNP):  After sending the ACK to the
    /confirm call, the SNP initiates the /on_confirm call to the BNP. This call includes
    the same order_id provided by the BNP in the /confirm call, along with the final
    order details, including the quote, payment details (as in /confirm), and cancellation
    terms.  It may also include additional information like fulfillment slots, agent
    details, or e-way bill numbers (especially for logistics). BNP Validations: The
    BNP, upon receiving the /on_confirm call, performs its own validations to ensure
    the order details match what was sent in the /confirm call. ACK or NACK to /on_confirm
    (BNP to SNP): Successful Validation (ACK): If the BNP''s validation is successful,
    it responds with an ACK to the /on_confirm call.  This triggers the SNP to forward
    the order to the merchant for processing and fulfillment. Validation Failure (NACK):
    If the validation fails, the BNP responds with a NACK and an error code (e.g.,
    23002). The SNP should then cancel the order with a specific reason code (e.g.,
    998) and notify the BNP of the cancellation through an /on_status call. Internal
    Errors (NACK):  Similar to the /confirm call, the BNP might send a NACK due to
    internal errors, prompting the SNP to retry the /on_confirm call. Retries and
    Cancellation: Both the /confirm and /on_confirm calls should be idempotent.  If
    either party doesn''t receive an ACK/NACK within a defined retry interval, they
    should cancel the order with the appropriate reason code.  This ensures that orders
    are not left in an undefined state.'

    status of an order.  It uses the same transaction_id that was used for the /confirm
    call when the order was placed. This ensures that the status request is linked
