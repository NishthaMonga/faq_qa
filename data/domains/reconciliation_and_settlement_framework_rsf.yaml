- question: What is RSF in ONDC?
  answer: 'The Reconciliation and Settlement Framework (RSF) in ONDC defines the process
    by which Network Participants (NPs) settle funds for on-network transactions.
    It ensures secure, transparent, and efficient fund flow through: Digital signatures
    for non-repudiation Integration with banks via Settlement Agencies (e.g., NBBL)
    Batch-based settlement advice generation and routing Final settlement within T+1
    days via APIs (/settle, /on_settle) RSF supports compliance with RBI guidelines
    and builds trust across the ONDC network.'

- question: What is the transaction flow in RSF ?
  answer: 'The image outlines the detailed transaction flow for Reconciliation and
    Settlement in a three-party setup: Collector, Settlement Agency, and Receiver.
    Here''s a brief explanation:

    1. Settlement Phase:

    Collector & Receiver: Collector and Receiver both send the /settle call to the
    settlement  agency. Settlement Agency: Receives settlement instructions from both
    Collector and Receiver. Compare them to check for matching orders and amounts.
    If matched: proceeds to settlement. If mismatched: Share /on_settle with the status
    NOT_SETTLED with Collector & Receiver. 2. Mismatch Reconciliation Among NPs: This
    part deals with resolving mismatches between participants. Mismatch Process: Reconciliation
    /recon sent to counterparty. If mismatch is found: Counterparty reviews and responds
    with on_recon diff_amount flag. ​​'

- question: Is the settlement process expected to be carried out on a daily basis,
    or does it depend on the mutual decision of the buyer and seller (as both need
    to send /settle to S.A)?
  answer: Settlement takes as agreed between the buyer app (collector) and seller
    app (receiver) viz. agreed through the settlement_window and settlement_basis
    attribute. The settlement cycle shall run once every day in the initial phase.
    Buyer Applications (Collector) are strongly suggested to send a daily /settle
    call, even if there are null settlements for the day to ensure deductions don’t
    happen based on the settlement call of the Seller Application (Receiver). In cases,
    Seller Applications (Receiver) sends a settle call for which there is no Call
    from the Buyer Application (Collector), money will get debited from the Collector.

- question: How will we know the tds and tcs value?

    provide the money to be moved from collector to receiver. Calculations and reconciliation
    among NPs are to be taken up in recon/ on_recon

- question: Where can we use the TO_BE_INITIATED status in settlement?

    irrespective of whether an order’s settlement amount has been settled or not.
    In case, the recon API is called for an order before the settlement has taken
    place, the status for the same would be TO_BE_INITIATED.

- question: What is the use of /Report, /On_Report APIs?
  answer: Report APIs can be used by the Collector or Receiver to know about the status
    of a settlement call from the Settlement Agency. The situation can arise due to
    edge case scenarios where the participant does not receive a /On_Settle call from
    the SA and therefore wants to know of the Settle Status. The caller of the API
    can mention the reference Transaction id and Reference Message id in the /Report
    call and Settlement Agency will share details on /On_Report API

- question: What is the use of /Recon, /On_Recon APIs?
  answer: "The reconciliation process among the NPs are facilitated through the recon\
    \ and on_recon APIs. In case settlement instructions are shared to the settlement\
    \ agency and it fails for certain orders due an order mismatch or an order amount\
    \ mismatch, NPs shall leverage the recon and on_recon API to communicate the mismatches.\
    \ /recon:- In case an NP receives an order amount mismatch error code from the\
    \ settlement agency, the receiver initiates the /recon request to the collector\
    \ providing the breakup details for the respective order ID(s). \n/on_recon:-\
    \ The collector then reconciles and responds with the on_recon including the difference\
    \ amount after getting the recon call. In case an NP receives an order id mismatch\
    \ error code (i.e. order ID not shared by the counterparty), the NP is expected\
    \ to call the /recon API of the respective counterparty with the specific order\
    \ ID(s) and its breakup details. The counterparty then reconciles and responds\
    \ with details specific to the order id requested. In both cases, if the response\
    \ is correctly reconciled for the requisite orders, the settlement is initiated\
    \ in the next settlement cycle. Otherwise, NPs are expected to raise an IGM for\
    \ resolving the differences."

    Misc Settlement call can also be used by an MSN Seller Network participant to
    transfer money from its NOCA account to its Seller’s Operative Current Account

  answer: '"@ondc/org/settlement_basis":"delivery", "@ondc/org/settlement_window":"P1D",
    "@ondc/org/withholding_amount":"10.00

    A settlement basis is the event based on which the settlement is to be initiated
    at the time of settlement window. So, delivery as the settlement basis and 3 as
    the settlement window would mean the settlement instruction has to be sent on
    the 3rd day from the delivery date.'

- question: I am seeking clarification on the settlement process in scenarios where.
  answer: The seller-side order is partially canceled. The buyer-side order is fully
    canceled. As a seller app, we need to understand how settlement and reconciliation
    are handled in these cases. Could you please provide guidance on this process?
    Typically, settlement of the order for now takes place after a terminal state
    in the retail domains, for example return window plus 7 days. Whether the order
    is seller side or buyer side cancelled is immaterial given fund movement will
    take place post a terminal state. For a completely cancelled order, if there are
    no cancellation charges, no settlement needs to be done For a partially cancelled
    order, the fund needs to be settled based on the remaining portion of the order
    quote.
